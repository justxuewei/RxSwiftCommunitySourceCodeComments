# RxSwift Community Source Code Comments

This project shows my comments to source code of RxSwift, which is one of the concrete implementations on reactive programming for Swift. All the comments by myself have 'Xavier Marks:' prefix, which make you find them quickly. The source code I uses is based on `RxSwift v5.0.1` designed for Swift 5,  iOS 13 and macOS Catalina. If you have any question, please feel free to create an issue on Github or email to me.
