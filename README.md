# RxSwift Community Source Code Comments

This project shows comments to source code of RxSwift, which is one of the concrete implementations on reactive programming for Swift. All the code commentted out by myself have 'Marked by Xavier:' prefix, which make you find them quickly. 

The source code is based on `RxSwift v5.0.1` designed for Swift 5, iOS 13 and macOS Catalina. You can open the project with XCode 11.

If you have any question, please feel free to create an issue on Github or email to me.
